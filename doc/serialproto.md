# Serial protocol

## Introduction

Since RS485 is a multi device bus with a single master all commands are prefixed
by an address as well the command length. Note these are not compatible with the
Thyracont devices so they cannot share the same RS485 bus unfortunately.

Requests are always initiated by the master. They are _always_ prefixed by a
single byte address byte as well as a single byte length field. The length
does not include the address as well as the length field.

The bus operates at a baud rate of 57600.

All multi-byte integers are encoded in _little endian_ format.

## Overview

All commands and responses are sent via RS485. The device is usually in listening mode

| Code | Command        | Arguments      | Description                                                                                     |

| 0x04 | Set position   | 2 positions    | Sets the position target for both motors. They start moving on the next tick towards the target |
| 0x05 | Get speed      |                | Returns a "speed" setting - this sets the delay between steps in timer ticks                    |
| 0x06 | Set speed      | 2 delay values | Sets a "speed" setting - this sets the delay between steps in timer ticks                       |
| 0x07 | Get status     |                | Returns status flags. Currently only defined if the motor is moving or not                      |
